# Introduction

Modern CMake recommends to use a target based approach to including libraries. This example shows how to support this using
conan in an example that is functionally the same as the previous one.

# Concepts

## Libraries Targets

As described in the link:https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples/tree/master/01-basic/H-third-party-library[third party library] example, CMake recommends to use +ALIAS+ targets for third party libraries. An example of
adding an imported target is

[source,cmake]
----
  target_link_libraries( third_party_include
      PRIVATE
          Boost::filesystem
  )
----


## Conan Imported Targets

To configure conan to use imported targets add the argument +TARGETS+ to the +conan_basic_setup+ function. This will cause conan to create a `CONAN_PKG::pkg_name` target that can be imported as a library.

An example of this using the `fmt` library is below:

[source,cmake]
----
  conan_basic_setup(TARGETS)

  add_executable(third_party_include)
  
  target_link_libraries(third_party_include
      PRIVATE
          CONAN_PKG::fmt
  )
----

# Building the Example

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir build

$ cd build/

$ conan install ..
Configuration:
[settings]
arch=x86_64
arch_build=x86_64
build_type=Release
compiler=gcc
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.version=5
os=Linux
os_build=Linux
[options]
[build_requires]
[env]
