# Introduction

Using link:https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Testing_With_CTest[CTest] you can generate
a `make test` target to run automated unit-tests. This example shows how to
find the https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2[catch2 framework],
create tests and run them.

# Requirements

A C++11 compatible compiler

# Concepts

## Vendoring catch2

As catch2 is available as a single header file I have downloaded it and checked it into my repository. This mean
that I don't have any external dependencies when building my project. This is one of the
https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#getting-catch2[simplest] ways to use Catch2.

## Catch2 Interface Library

The CMakeLists in the catch2 directory creates an `INTERFACE` library and `ALIAS` library to make it
easy to add Catch2 to your executable.

[source,cmake]
----
add_library(Catch2 INTERFACE)
add_library(Catch2::Test ALIAS Catch2)
target_include_directories(Catch2 INTERFACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
----

## Build with C++11

As Catch2 requires C++11 to build, I have used the `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to set C++11. As described
in earlier examples you can use other methods to set this standard.

## Enabling testing

To enable testing you must include the following line in your top level CMakeLists.txt

[source,cmake]
----
enable_testing()
----

This will enable testing for the current folder and all folders below it.

## Adding a testing executable

The requirement for this step will depend on your unit-test framework. In the example
of catch2, you can create binary(s) which includes all the unit tests that you want to run.

[source,cmake]
----
add_executable(unit_tests unit_tests.cpp)

target_link_libraries(unit_tests
    example_unit_test
    Catch2::Test
)
----

In the above code, a unit test binary is added, which links against the catch2 `ALIAS` target created earlier.

## Add A test

To add a test you call the link:https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/add_test.html[`add_test()`] function.
This will create a named test which will run the supplied command.

[source,cmake]
----
add_test(test_all unit_tests)
----

In this example, we create a test called `test_all` which will run the executable
created by the `unit_tests` executable created from the call to `add_executable`

# Building the Example

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir build

$ cd build/

$ cmake ..

If the code is changed and it causes the unit tests to produce an error.
Then when running the tests you will see the following output.
